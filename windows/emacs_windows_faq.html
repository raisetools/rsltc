<h3><a name="TOC15">What is Emacs?</a></h3>


<p>
&nbsp;"Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
display editor. "
</p>
<p>
For a more detailed description, see the GNU pages at <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html" >http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html</a>.

<h3><a name="TOC16">Which versions of Windows are supported?</a></h3>

<p>
This port is known to run on all versions of Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT, Windows XP, and Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Windows port is built using the Windows Win32 API and supports most of the features of the Unix version, there are some omissions at this time, which will be available in the future, these are:

<p>
Eli Zaretskii &lt;<A HREF="mailto:eliz@is.elta.co.il">eliz@is.elta.co.il</A>&gt;
 maintains the port of GNU Emacs
for MSDOS and MS Windows.  You can download precompiled versions
with the latest DJGPP archives:

<ul>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu/emacs.README">ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu/emacs.README</a>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu/">ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu</a>
</ul>

<p>
Eli strongly recommends that you start with the emacs.README file:
it contains crucial info about what's in the other 10 zip files and
how to install them and get started with Emacs on MSDOS/MS-Windows
platforms.

<p>
More from Eli:

<blockquote>
It might be of interest to Windows users that this version of Emacs
supports long filenames (Windows 9x only - not Windows NT, or Windows 2000)
and the Windows clipboard (all
versions of MS-Windows).  It also supports multiple frames, but they all
overlap, like when Emacs runs on a ``glass teletype'' terminal.

<p>
People who would like to run Emacs on plain DOS (as opposed to Windows)
will need to download and install a DPMI host at this URL:

<h3><a name="TOC18">MULE/Meadow</a></h3>


<p>
Hisashi Miyashita &lt;<A HREF="mailto:himi@bird.scphys.kyoto-u.ac.jp">himi@bird.scphys.kyoto-u.ac.jp</A>&gt;
 maintains
MULE, multilingual Emacs, and its descendant; Meadow.  You can get
distributions of MULE at <a href="ftp://ftp.tokyonet.ad.jp/pub/windows/win32/mule-win32">ftp://ftp.tokyonet.AD.JP/pub/windows/win32/mule-win32</a>.
With the multilingual support now merged into NTEmacs in 20.4, it is no
longer necessary to use a special version of Emacs for other languages, but
MULE users may find upgrading to Meadow easier than to NTEmacs because of
slight differences in the way they handle fonts.  Meadow also has a couple
of features that are still missing from NTEmacs, such as support for native
IMEs and the special keys on Japanese keyboards.

<h3><a name="TOC22">Where can I get the source distribution?</a></h3>


<p>
The latest source distribution can be found in <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/latest">
http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/latest</a>.  It is distributed in two
formats: one large gzipped tar file (emacs*.tar.gz), and a collection of
smaller zip files that can be copied to 1.44 Mbyte floppies
(em-src-_?.zip).

<p>
In the same directory you should also find patch files that enable you
to upgrade source distributions to the latest version.  These patch files
are mirrors of the ones on the FSF server at <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu">http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu</a>.

<p>
You can also browse the source online; look in <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/latest">http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/latest</a>
for a directory named "emacs-&lt;version&gt;".

<p>
  For more information  about the contents of the various files you
 should read the README file contained in the FTP directory.

<A NAME="where-source-cvs" title="where-source-cvs"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC23">Can I get the source via CVS?</a></h3>

<p>
  &nbsp;Yes you can - Emacs sources can now be obtained via CVS.  This will allow you to keep up to date with the latest bug fixes, and incremental updates.
<P>
  &nbsp;In order to get source in this manner you'll need some form of CVS client - see <A HREF="#where-cvs">here</A> for details of where to find one.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;Once you have a working CVS setup you can find download the source :
</P>
<P>&nbsp;Emacs CVS repository can be checked out through anonymous (pserver) CVS with the following instructions. When prompted for a password for anoncvs, simply press the Enter key.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;The following commands should checkout the current version of the source:
</P>

<A NAME="where-precompiled" title="where-precompiled"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC24">Where can I get precompiled versions?</a></h3>


<p>
Starting with Emacs 20.4, precompiled distributions are being hosted at
<a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/">ftp.gnu.org</a>.  Distributions for the latest
version are at:

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs">http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs</a> (top level directory)
<li> <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/latest">http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/latest</a> (latest distributions)
</ul>

<p>
Distributions for all architectures and the source are now in the same
directory; look for the architecture-specific binary distribution for your
machine (e.g., Intel NT and Win9X have "bin-i386" in the distribution
name).

<p>
Now that the precompiled distributions are hosted on ftp.gnu.org, they
also take advantage of all of the gnu ftp mirrors.  A list of gnu mirror
sites can be found at <a href="http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html" >http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html</a>;
once you are at one of those sites, look in the gnu/windows/emacs
sudirectory to find the NT Emacs directory.

<p>
There are also a number of sites that just mirror the NT Emacs
distributions:

<b>Regarding ftp.cs.washington.edu:</b> I've had numerous reports from
people outside North America saying that their ftp connection aborts for no
apparent reason roughly a third of the way through a transfer of a full
distribution.
Marc Haber &lt;<A HREF="mailto:s_haber@ira.uka.de">s_haber@ira.uka.de</A>&gt;
 said that he suffered from
the same problem, and later found that a timeout configured into his WWW
proxy would cancel the transfer when the link to the US was very busy.
Going around his proxy solved the problem.
Andy Moreton &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ajm@atml.co.uk">ajm@atml.co.uk</A>&gt;
 describes his situation when using SOCKS:

<blockquote>
The FAQ page mentions some people have problems downloading - I may be
able to shed some light on it. Our site has a reasonably secure
firewall, and so all access to the outside world requires use of
SOCKS based connections via a SOCKS5 server (i.e. a circuit-level
gateway).

<p>
When doing an FTP transfer, two connections are up - a telnet for the
control connection, and the data transfer on another. As the telnet
connection is idle during the file transfer, the SOCKS server
disconnects it. Some FTP servers get upset by this (especially the NT
FTP server), and drop the data connection if the control connection
goes down.
</blockquote>

<p>
If you do have trouble downloading the full distribution, try
downloading it in the 1.44MB chunks, or try one of the mirror sites.

<A NAME="compile" title="compile"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC25">I dont want the precompiled version. How do I compile Emacs myself?</a></h3>


<p>
To compile Emacs, you will need either Microsoft C compiler package or the
Cygwin compiler.
<p>
For Windows NT the Microsoft C copmiler can be any of the SDK compilers from NT 3.1 and up, Microsoft
Visual C++ for NT (versions 1.0 and up), or Microsoft Visual C++
(versions 2.0 and up).  For Windows 95, this can be Microsoft Visual
C++ versions 2.0 and up.

<p>
Download and place the source distribution in a directory (say,
c:\emacs).  Unpack the distribution, and go to the nt subdirectory of the
emacs directory that gets created in the unpacking process.  Read the
README and INSTALL files included with the distribution for the full
details of this process.


<A NAME="compile-debug" title="compile-debug"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC26">How do I use a debugger on Emacs?</a></h3>


<p>
Emacs is just like any other Windows application compiled and linked
using MSVC, and it can be debugged using Windows debuggers like DevStudio.
By default, Emacs will compile with debugging options turned on.  Once
compiled, you should be able to load either temacs.exe, the undumped
executable, or emacs.exe, the dumped executable, into the debugger (almost
always you will want to debug emacs.exe).

<p>
Note that Emacs has conventions for naming built-in C identifiers
corresponding to lisp functions and variables.  You will, of course, need
to use the C identifier names when examining variables and setting
breakpoints.  The C identifier versions of lisp identifiers have dashes
converted to underscores, and they are prefixed with a capital letter
denoting the type of lisp object that they refer to (functions use 'F',
variables use 'V', etc.).  For example, the C function implementing the
lisp function <tt>expand-file-name</tt> is <tt>Fexpand_file_name</tt>, and
the C variable corresponding to the lisp variable <tt>load-path</tt> is
<tt>Vload_path</tt>.

<A NAME="install" title="install"><!-- Anchor--></A>


<A NAME="unpack" title="unpack"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC28">How do I unpack the distributions?</a></h3>


<p>
Open a command prompt (MSDOS) window.  Decide on a directory in which
to place Emacs.  Move the distribution to that directory, and then
unpack it.  If you have the gzipped tar version, first use gunzip to
uncompress the tar file, and then use tar with the "xvfm" flags to
extract the files from the tar file:

<blockquote><pre>
% gunzip -c -d emacs.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
(Note: Apparently the alpha version of gunzip cannot handle long file
names, so you will need to rename the file to something like "emacstar.gz"
before uncompressing it.)

<p>
The "-d" flag forces gunzip to decompress (its behavior depends upon
the case of the name of the executable, and sometimes it doesn't recognize
that it is really gunzip), and the "-c" flag tells it to pipe its output to
stdout.  Similarly, the "-" flag to tar tells it to read the tar file from
stdin.  Unpacking the distribution this way leaves the distribution in
compressed form so it takes up less space.

<p>
You may see messages from tar about not being able to change the
modification time on directories, and from gunzip complaining about a
broken pipe.  These messages are harmless and you can ignore them.

<p>
If for some reason you also want to have the tar file gunzipped, then
invoke gunzip without the -c option:

<blockquote><pre>
% gunzip -d emacs.tar.gz
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you have the zip version, use unzip with the "-x" flag on all of the
 .zip files (note that you cannot use pkunzip on these files, as pkunzipwill not preserve the long filenames):

<blockquote><pre>
% unzip -x emacs-_1.zip
% (repeat for the remaining .zip files)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
You can find precompiled versions of all of the compression and
archive utilities in <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/utilities">
http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/utilities
</a> (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html" >ftp mirrors</a>).

<A NAME="unpack-install" title="unpack-install"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC29">How do I install Emacs, after unpacking?</a></h3>

<p>
After unpacking the archive there's very little left to do, you have
the choice of:
<ul>
<li>Simply running emacs-20.x\bin\runemacs.exe
<li>Running emacs-20.x\bin\addpm.exe
</ul>

If you run &quot;addpm.exe&quot;, and answer OK to the message
box that pops up then GNU Emacs will be added to your start menu,
and certain registry keys will be created for you.  This isn't
compulsorary as in previous releases - so the choice is yours.

</P>
<P>
  &nbsp;To customize Emacs mostly involves writing extra functions in
 Lisp, or changing variables that affect the behaviour which is already

</P>
<P>
  &nbsp;Emacs reads a file &quot;.emacs&quot; when it starts up, this

</P>

<A NAME="what-startup" title="what-startup"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC32">What is a .emacs file?</a></h3>

<p>
  When Emacs starts up it attempts to load, and execute the contents
 of a file called &quot;.emacs&quot;, or &quot;_emacs&quot;.
  This file is where all the customizations are saved, and restored
 from when you restart Emacs.
  All of these settings are stored as Lisp expressions, for a general
 introduction to Lisp you could see : <A HREF="http://www.cons.org/">http://cons.org</A>, more Emacs Specific information can be found in the
  <A HREF="http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/emacs/emacs_toc.html">Emacs Lisp Manual</A>.
</p>

<A NAME="startup" title="startup"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC33">Where do I put my .emacs, (or _emacs), file?</a></h3>


<p>
Your startup file can be named either _emacs or .emacs, and should be
placed in your "home" directory.  If you have both files in your home
directory, Emacs will load the .emacs file and ignore _emacs.

<p>
Your home directory is where the HOME configuration variable tells
Emacs it is.  As with the other Emacs configuration variables, HOME can be
set in a number of ways:

<ul>

<li><b>Environment variable:</b> Emacs will always first check to see
if you have an environment variable named HOME set and use that value
as your home directory.  Under Windows 95, you can set the HOME environment
variable in your autoexec.bat file (you will need to reboot); under
NT, you can set the HOME environment variable in the System panel of
the Control Panel.  (Note that if you set HOME as an environment
variable in the System panel it will only take effect in new processes
created after you've closed the System panel; if it still does not
appear to be working, then you might try rebooting.)

<li><b>Registry:</b> If Emacs doesn't find an environment variable
named HOME, it will check the registry for a value named HOME and use that
value as your home directory.  Emacs first checks the key
"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\GNU\\Emacs", and then the key
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\GNU\\Emacs" (although the use of the latter
key is discouraged since HOME should be set on a per-user basis, not on a
per-machine basis).  Note that the value of HOME is <i>not</i> set by the
addpm.exe program that initializes the registry with the other Emacs
configuration variables.

</ul>

<p>
If Emacs cannot find HOME set in any of the above locations, it will
assume your HOME directory is "C:/".

<p>
The directory specified by HOME is also the directory substituted for
tildes (~) in file names used in Emacs (so, by definition, you can always
load your startup file in Emacs by doing C-x C-f "~/.emacs").

<p>
<b>Troubleshooting:</b> If you've set HOME to a directory using one of
the above methods, and Emacs still doesn't load your startup file, the
first thing you should do is check to see what Emacs thinks HOME is set to.
You can do this by evaluating the following expression in the *scratch*
buffer using C-x C-e:

<blockquote><pre>
(insert (getenv "HOME"))
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Look carefully at what is printed and make sure the value is valid.
For example, if the value has trailing whitespace, Emacs won't be able to
find the directory.  Also, be sure that the value isn't a relative drive
letter (e.g., "d:" without a backslash); if it is, then HOME is going to be
whatever the current directory on that drive is, which is likely not what
you want to happen.

<h3><a name="TOC36">How do I associate files with Emacs (i.e., use Emacs as a server with gnuserv/gnuclient)?</a></h3>

<p>
You can use a package like gnuserv to associate files with Emacs so
that opening a file outside of Emacs (e.g., by double-clicking on its icon)
will create a new frame in a running Emacs displaying that file.

It now works on all the Windows platforms that NTEmacs supports, and
has a number of usefull features.

<dd>This is the accompanying page, which describes its features, and setup.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Be sure to place the gnuserv executables in your path (or modify
your path or Emacs' exec-path to include them), and be sure that
runemacs.exe is in your path if you use gnuserv to launch Emacs.

<p>
Note that you can set up file associations in Windows 95/98/NT 4.0 using
Explorer by selecting the "View->Options..." menu operation, and then
clicking on the "File Types" tab in the dialog that pops up.  Clicking on a
file type will allow you to edit it and associate the file with
gnuclient.exe.

<p>
<b>Warning:</b> Be sure to quote the %1 in the association so that
filenames with blanks in them are treated as one argument when sent to
Emacs, e.g.:

<blockquote><pre>
C:\bin\gnuclientw.exe "%1"

<A NAME="assoc-frames" title="assoc-frames"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC37">Controlling the use of frames</a></h3>


<p>
By default, gnuserv will load files into new frames.  If you would
rather have gnuserv load files into an existing frame, then evaluate the
following in the chosen frame:

<blockquote><pre>
(setq gnuserv-frame (selected-frame))
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Placing the above in your startup file, for example, will have gnuserv
load files into the original Emacs frame. <b>Note:</b> one drawback of this
approach is that if the frame associated with gnuserv is ever closed,
gnuserv won't have a frame in which to place buffers.

<h3><a name="TOC43">How do I swap CapsLock and Control?</a></h3>

<p>
CapsLock and Control cannot be swapped from within Emacs, and Windows

bindings.  Instead, new keyboard layouts or device drivers can be
installed, or the registry can be modified, to swap the two keys.

<p>
<b>W<font size=-1>ARNING</font>:</b> If you use a new keyboard layout
to switch CapsLock and Control, beware of the option to use hotkey
sequences to switch keyboard layouts.  This option is in Control
Panel->Keyboard under the Language (Windows 95) or Input Locales (Windows NT) tabs; the
sequences themselves are "Left Alt+Control" and "Ctrl+Shift".  If you
enable one of these options, then you will likely at some point switch
keyboard layouts while trying to use an Emacs key combination.

The only thing that Emacs changes in your system is the registry (if

files in your system directory.  If you don't mind the registry settings
remaining in the registry, then you don't need to do anything to uninstall
Emacs.

<p>
If you want to remove the registry settings, then you can use the
<tt>regedt32</tt> program to remove the Emacs registry keys.  Depending
upon what kind of permissions you have, the registry entries could have
been installed in either HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\GNU\Emacs or

<A NAME="troubleshooting" title="troubleshooting"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC50">When I run Emacs, nothing happens. Whats the deal?</a></h3>

<p>
Emacs could have failed to run for a number of reasons.  The most
common symptom is that, when Emacs is started, the cursor changes for
a second but nothing happens.  If this happens to you, it is quite
likely that the distribution was unpacked incorrectly.

<p>
Check for the following to see if there was a problem during
unpacking:

<ol>

<li>Be sure to disable the CR/LF translation or the executables will be
unusable.  Older versions of WinZipNT would enable this translation by
default.  If you are using WinZipNT, disable it.

<li>Check that filenames were not truncated to 8.3.  For example, in
Emacs 19.34.6 there should be a file lisp\term\win32-win.el (it has been
renamed to w32-win.el in Emacs 20); if this has been truncated to
win32-wi.el, your distribution has been corrupted while unpacking and Emacs
will not start.

<li>I've also had reports that the GNU Windows port of tar corrupts the
executables.  Use the version of tar on my ftp site instead.
</ol>

<p>
If you are in doubt about whether the utilities you used unpacked the
distribution incorrectly, use the gunzip, tar, and unzip executables
provided in the utilities directory.  These are the ones I use to create
and test the distributions.  My advice would be to use these utilities from
the start.

<p>
If it is still not working, send mail to the
 <A HREF="#ntemacs-list">list</A>, describing what you've done, and what you
are seeing.  (The more information you send the more likely it is that you'll
receive a helpfull response..

<A NAME="hostname" title="hostname"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC58">How does Emacs determine the name of my computer?</a></h3>

<p>
Emacs initializes the variable "system-name" with the name of your
computer upon startup.  However, Emacs uses two different methods for
determining the computer name depending upon whether Winsock is loaded by
default when Emacs starts up.  If Winsock is automatically loaded, then
Emacs uses <tt>gethostname</tt>, otherwise Emacs uses
<tt>GetComputerName</tt>.  Alternatively, you can override all of this by
explicitly setting <tt>system-name</tt> in your startup file (also look at
<tt>user-mail-address</tt> for composing mail messages).

<p>
By default, Emacs does not automatically load Winsock because doing so
will cause Winsock to establish a connection to the network.  If you are
connected to a LAN, then nothing will happen, but if you dialup to an ISP
then invoking Emacs (thereby loading Winsock) will prompt you to
unexpectedly dialup to your ISP.

<p>
You can have Emacs automatically load Winsock by defining the
environment variable <tt>PRELOAD_WINSOCK</tt>.  You can set it to an
arbitrary value; Emacs just checks to see if it is defined.  Similarly, you
can create a registry entry <tt>PRELOAD_WINSOCK</tt> with the other Emacs
registry entries (in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\GNU\Emacs or
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\GNU\Emacs), which will do the same thing.

<h3><a name="TOC59">How do I change the size, position, font, and color attributes of Emacs?</a></h3>

<p>
Emacs can run in two different interface modes: the Windows interface,
which allows the flexible use and mixture of fonts and colors; and the
console interface, which constrains Emacs to the limitations of
console windows.  The following two sections describe how to specify
and change the size, position, font, and color attributes of Emacs in
both interface modes.


<A NAME="windows-attributes" title="windows-attributes"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC60">Windows Interface</a></h3>

<p>
With the Windows interface, you can change the size, position, font,
and color attributes of Emacs using three different mechanisms: using
the mouse with the user interface, by specifying them as command line
arguments, or by invoking Emacs Lisp functions.  You will probably
find it convenient to specify command line arguments in the
<b>Properties</b> of the shortcut to the runemacs.exe file, and to
invoke the lisp functions in your startup file.  For information on
how to propagate attributes to new frames, see  <A HREF="#windows-frames">the section below on frames</A> .

<ul>
<li>

<A NAME="windows-size" title="windows-size"><!-- Anchor--></A>

<b>S<font size=-1>IZE</font></b>

<p>
To customize the size of specific frames, including the initial frame, see
the  <A HREF="#windows-frames">section on customizing frames</A>  below.

<dl>
<dt><b>User Interface</b>

<dd>To resize an Emacs window, drag on a border with the mouse.

<dt><b>Command Line</b>

<dd>To have Emacs start up with a particular size, invoke it with the
X Windows <b>-geometry</b> command line argument.  For example, to
start Emacs with a window 40 lines by 80 columns in size, use the
following:

<blockquote>
<tt>emacs -g 80x40</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that the geometry command can be combined with the position
command, as described below.

<dt><b>Emacs Lisp</b>

<dd>To change the size of an Emacs frame using elisp, you can use the
two functions <tt>set-frame-width</tt> and <tt>set-frame-height</tt>.
For example, to resize Emacs to display 40 lines by 80 columns, you could
use:

<blockquote><pre>
(set-frame-height (selected-frame) 40)
<br>(set-frame-width (selected-frame) 80)
</pre></blockquote>

<A NAME="windows-position" title="windows-position"><!-- Anchor--></A>

<b>P<font size=-1>OSITION</font></b>

<p>
To customize the position of specific frames, including the initial frame,
see the  <A HREF="#windows-frames">section on customizing frames</A>  below.

<dl>
<dt><b>User Interface</b>

<dd>To reposition a running Emacs, click on its title bar and drag the
window.

<dt><b>Command Line</b>

<dd>To start Emacs at a particular position, invoke it with the X
Windows <b>-geometry</b> command line argument.  For example, to start
Emacs at pixel offset (10, 30) from the top left corner:

<blockquote>
<tt>emacs -g +10+30</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
To combine the size with position, first specify the size and then
the position.  The two examples above can be combined as follows:

<blockquote>
<tt>emacs -g 80x40+10+30</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that you can also specify position offsets from any of the
corners of the screen.  See the <a href="http://www.x.org/consortium/R6doc/man/X/X" >GEOMETRY
SPECIFICATIONS section</a> of the X man page for complete details on
the geometry command.

<dt><b>Emacs Lisp</b>

<dd>To reposition an Emacs frame using elisp, you can use the
<tt>set-frame-position</tt> function.  For example, to move the
current frame to the offset (10, 30), you could use:

<blockquote>
<tt>(set-frame-position (selected-frame) 10 30)</tt>
</blockquote>

</dl>

<A NAME="windows-color" title="windows-color"><!-- Anchor--></A>

<b>C<font size=-1>OLORS</font></b>

<p>
As with other windowing attributes, Emacs uses the X Windows color
names for specifying colors on the command line and in elisp.  One set of
these names is a set of abstract color names, e.g., <b>red</b>,
<b>green</b>, and <b>blue</b>.  These names are the ones you will typically
use as arguments on the command line or in elisp functions.  Emacs also
supports the use of numeric color names; see the <a href="http://www.x.org/consortium/R6doc/man/X/X" >COLOR NAMES section</a> of
the X man page for complete details on how to specify numeric color names
and their color spaces.

<p>
To see the abstract color names that Emacs understands and the colors
that they map to, use the menu command <b>Edit</b>-><b>Text
Properties</b>-><b>Display Colors</b>, or invoke the
<tt>list-colors-display</tt> function in the *scratch* buffer:

<blockquote>
<tt>(list-colors-display)</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you would like to change the mapping of color names to RGB values,
or to add new color names to Emacs, then you will want to modify the
alist <b>w32-color-map</b> (<b>win32-color-map</b> in Emacs 19).  To
make changes, you can simply cons new mappings onto the head of the
alist:

<blockquote><pre>
(setq win32-color-map (cons '("snow" . 16448255) win32-color-map)) ; Emacs 19
(setq w32-color-map   (cons '("snow" . 16448255) w32-color-map))   ; Emacs 20
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The number in the element is the logical OR of three values for the
red, green, and blue components: (B &lt;&lt; 16 | G &lt;&lt; 8 | R).  In
the example above, red is 255, green is 250, and blue is 250.  At some
point there will be support for reading in files with color mappings
to make this process a little easier.

<p>
To customize colors for specific frames, see the  <A HREF="#windows-frames">section on customizing frames</A>  below.

<p>
To customize colors for color syntax highlighting, see the  <A HREF="#font-lock">section on font-lock</A> .

<dl>

<dt><b>User Interface</b>

<dd>To change the foreground or background color in Emacs through the
windowing interface, you can use the menu commands <b>Foreground
Color</b>-><b>Other</b> and <b>Background Color</b>-><b>Other</b> in
the <b>Edit</b>-><b>Text Properties</b> menu.

<dt><b>Command Line</b>

<dd>To change the foreground or background color in Emacs on
the command line, you can use the <b>-fg</b> and <b>-bg</b>
command line arguments.  For example, to start Emacs with yellow
text on a black background, invoke Emacs using:

<blockquote>
<tt>emacs -fg yellow -bg black</tt>
</blockquote>

<dt><b>Emacs Lisp</b>

<dd>You can use elisp functions to change the colors of any of the
Emacs faces.  For example, to change the foreground or background
color of Emacs, you can use the <tt>set-foreground-color</tt> and
<tt>set-background-color</tt> functions.  To change the color of an
arbitrary face, use the <tt>set-face-foreground</tt> and
<tt>set-face-background</tt> functions.  To change the color of the
cursor, use the <tt>set-cursor-color</tt> function.

<p>
This elisp changes the background color to black:

<blockquote>
<tt>(set-background-color "black")</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
The following elisp changes the mode line foreground to firebrick:

<blockquote>
<tt>(set-face-foreground 'modeline "firebrick")</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
The following elisp changes the cursor color to purple:

<blockquote>
<tt>(set-cursor-color "purple")</tt>
</blockquote>

<A NAME="windows-frames" title="windows-frames"><!-- Anchor--></A>

<b>F<font size=-1>RAMES</font></b>

<p>
Emacs uses two alists to determine the default appearances of frames,
<tt>default-frame-alist</tt> and <tt>initial-frame-alist</tt>.  The
<tt>default-frame-alist</tt> variable sets the basic defaults of all
frames.  Since it is a common Emacs usage to have the initial frame have
slightly different properties than other frames (e.g., its position), you
can use the <tt>initial-frame-alist</tt> variable to override properties in
<tt>default-frame-alist</tt> specially for the initial frame.  You should
definitely read the help text for these variables (C-h v) for more details
on the differences between them and how they interact with each other.

<p>
Below is an example of using <tt>default-frame-alist</tt> and
<tt>initial-frame-alist</tt> to configure the appearances of the initial
frame and all other frames (you would place this code in your  <A HREF="#startup">startup file</A> ).  With <tt>default-frame-alist</tt>, we
set the top left corner of new frames to be at pixel offset +200+400, the
width and height to be 80x40, the cursor to be white, the foreground to be
yellow, the background to be black, and the font to be Courier 10.  With
<tt>initial-frame-alist</tt>, we override the top left corner of the
initial frame to be at pixel offset +10+30, and inherit the remaining
properties for the initial frame from <tt>default-frame-alist</tt>.

<blockquote><pre>
(setq default-frame-alist
      '((top . 200) (left . 400)
        (width . 80) (height . 40)
        (cursor-color . "white")

<h3><a name="TOC62">Emacs in console mode goes beyond the window size. What do I do?</a></h3>

<p>
With Emacs 20.3 and previous version, Emacs uses the size of the
console buffer as the frame size.  If your console window has buffer larger
than the window (e.g., it uses a verical scrollbar), then Emacs' frame will
be larger than the console window.  To work around this problem, make the
console buffer the size of the console window.  Or, if you have source,
apply <a href="ntemacs/patches/20.3.1/console-buffer.diff">this patch</a>

<A NAME="mouse" title="mouse"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC67">What do I do if I have problems with Emacs and my mouse buttons?</a></h3>

<p>
You can use either a two- or three-button mouse with Emacs.  If you
have trouble with either of these working with Emacs, see below.


<A NAME="mouse-2b" title="mouse-2b"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC68">How do I use Emacs with a two-button mouse?</a></h3>

<p>
Emacs assumes that you have a three-button mouse by default.  However,
if you have a two-button mouse, you can press both buttons at once to
emulate the missing middle button expected by Emacs.

<p>
Three variables control mouse button emulation under Emacs:
<tt>w32-num-mouse-buttons</tt>, <tt>w32-mouse-button-tolerance</tt>, and
<tt>w32-swap-mouse-buttons</tt> (<tt>win32-num-mouse-buttons</tt>,
<tt>win32-mouse-button-tolerance</tt>.
If you use help on
<tt>w32-num-mouse-buttons</tt> (i.e., with "C-h v"), it will tell you how
many buttons Emacs thinks your mouse has; if <tt>w32-num-mouse-buttons</tt>
is less than 3, then Emacs will emulate the middle mouse button.

<p>
Emacs emulates the middle mouse button by treating simultaneous button
presses of the left and right buttons as a middle button press.  Since both
button presses cannot really be simultaneous, Emacs compares button presses
within a specified window of time to determine whether it should emulate
the middle button.  This window of time is controlled using
<tt>w32-mouse-button-tolerance</tt>.  Help on this variable will show you
the value Emacs uses by default, and you can change this value to suit your
needs.

<p>
Depending upon the type of two-button mouse, you may find it useful to
swap the mapping of middle and right mouse buttons.  By default, the middle
button is mapped to <tt>mouse-2</tt> and the right button is mapped to
<tt>mouse-3</tt>.  If you set <tt>w32-swap-mouse-buttons</tt> to a non-nil
value, then you can swap these two mappings.

<h3><a name="TOC69">How do I get Emacs to recognize the third button on my mouse?</a></h3>

<p>
If you have a three-button mouse, Emacs should recognize and support
the third (middle) button automatically.  However, some people find that
they have a three button mouse, but the middle mouse button does not work
for them.  First check to see if <tt>w32-num-mouse-buttons</tt>
 is set correctly.  If so,
then check to see whether your mouse has been installed with the proper
driver (open Control Panel->Mouse to examine the driver being used).  If
you have the right driver, then, on NT, check if
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Busmouse\Paramete
rs\NumberOfButtons is set to 3, and change it to 3 if it is not.  If
nothing seems to be amiss, then at the very least you can have Emacs
emulate the middle button by setting <tt>w32-num-mouse-buttons</tt> to 2.

`selection-coding-system' is most likely still at it's default of

using `set-selection-coding-system' (C-x RET x), or temporarily with

Fonts in Emacs are named using the standard X Windows format for fonts.

(/a) of the X man page. -->

<p>
For an explanation of what each
element in a font string means and how Emacs on NT uses it, see <a href="ntemacs/discuss/x-font-details">Andrew's note</a>.

<p>
These font names are the names that can be used as arguments on the
command line or in lisp functions.  To see the font name corresponding to a
font chosen using the font selection dialog, execute the following elisp
code in the *scratch* buffer:

<blockquote><pre>

To see the complete list of fonts that Emacs has access to, execute
the following elisp code in the *scratch* buffer:

<blockquote>
<tt>(insert (prin1-to-string (x-list-fonts "*")))</tt>

<p>
The font support currently is a little rough around the edges.  In
particular, italic fonts give Emacs some problems; see  <A HREF="#windows-italics">below</A>  for more info about using italic
fonts.  Generally it performs as expected, but occasionally you might
get unexpected results (e.g., Emacs didn't quite use the font you told
it to use).  Work is underway to fix these problems, but for now I
suggest experimenting if you encounter problems.

<p>
Also, X Windows has the luxury of a set of font aliases (such as
<b>fixed</b>) that are convenient names for referring to specific fonts.
Work is underway to provide an equivalent alias mechanism under Windows so
that naming fonts does not have to be as cumbersome as it currently is.

<p>
To customize fonts for specific frames, see the  <A HREF="#windows-frames">section on customizing frames</A>  below.

<dl>

<dt><b>User Interface</b>

<dd>To change the default font that Emacs uses, shift click the left
mouse button (i.e., [shift-mouse-1]) and a font selection dialog will
pop up.  Select the font that you would like to use, and click on the
<b>OK</b> button to close the dialog and use the selected font.  (Note
that the dialog only displays fixed-pitch and screen fonts since Emacs
cannot handle variable-pitched fonts.)

<dt><b>Command Line</b>

<dd>To start Emacs with a particular font, use the the <b>-font</b> X
Windows command line option.  For example, to start Emacs with the
<b>Courier</b> font of size <b>10</b> and font style <b>Regular</b>,
invoke Emacs using:

<blockquote>
<tt>emacs -font "-*-Courier-normal-r-*-*-13-*-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1"</tt>
</blockquote>

<dt><b>Emacs Lisp</b>

<dd>To change the default font of Emacs using elisp, use the
<tt>set-default-font</tt> function:

<blockquote><pre>
(set-default-font "-*-Courier-normal-r-*-*-13-*-*-*-c-*-*-iso8859-1")
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
To set the font of a particular face, use the <tt>set-face-font</tt>
function.

<dt><b>Registry</b>

<dd>To change the default font of Emacs frames using registry entries,
create a value in the key <tt>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\GNU\Emacs</tt>:

<blockquote>
<b>Value Name:</b> <tt>Emacs.Font</tt>
<br><b>Value Type:</b> <tt>REG_SZ</tt>
<br><b>String:</b> <tt>-*-Courier-normal-r-*-*-13-*-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Since the font strings are rather cumbersome, I would suggest cutting
the font string into the kill-ring (which will place it in the
clipboard, too) and pasting it (Ctrl-V) into the regedit dialog.
(Note that you shouldn't place quotes around the font string in the
registry.)

<p>
If you have Emacs frames with specific names, you can also specify a
font for that frame.  For the <b>Value Name</b> of the entry, use the name
of the frame instead of <tt>Emacs</tt> (e.g., <tt>RMAIL.Font</tt> for your
RMAIL frame).

</dl>


<A NAME="windows-italics" title="windows-italics"><!-- Anchor--></A>

<b>I<font size=-1>TALICS</font></b>

<p>
Emacs currently requires that italic versions of fonts have the same
width as the normal version of the font.  However, most of the default
fonts have italic and italic bold versions whose character widths are
larger than the normal version (the only default font that appears to have
viable italic and bold versions is Courier New).  Because of this, Emacs by
default disables the use of italic faces.

<p>
You can still enable the use of italic faces with Emacs by setting the
variable <tt>w32-enable-italics</tt> to <tt>t</tt> in your startup file:

<blockquote><pre>
(setq w32-enable-italics t)    ; This must be done before font settings! (Emacs 20.x)
(set-face-font 'italic "-*-Courier New-normal-i-*-*-11-*-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1")
(set-face-font 'bold-italic "-*-Courier New-bold-i-*-*-11-*-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1")
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Although this works best with Courier New, there is still one minor
glitch: the italics versions are one pixel higher than the other
versions, so the line spacing is increased by a pixel when italics are
enabled.

<p>
More about using Windows fonts:

<blockquote>
There are a number of languages for which Windows fonts are not yet
available, or are not in an appropriate format for Emacs to use, so you
will not get every language to display. I also had some problem getting
Japanese, Chinese, Cantonese and Korean to display all at once, but this
was on Windows 95, and I suspect is a limitation of the OS, rather than a
bug in Emacs, as those languages look fine when displayed one at a time
(there is a note on the Microsoft language packs that only one may be
installed at a time, which I suspect is because of this limitation).

<p>
Because some languages can only use proportional fonts, limited support
has been added for proportional fonts as the non-ASCII font in fontsets. It
should be general enough to work with any font, but it is not full
proportional support, so the characters may not appear exactly as you
expect. You may need to try several fonts to find one that appears
reasonably correct if you wish to use Emacs with languages like Thai which
use composition and hence use only proportional Windows fonts.

<A NAME="multibyte-fontset" title="multibyte-fontset"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC79">How do I get Emacs to display characters other than ISO-8859-1 (West European)?</a></h3>

<p>
If you are content with the size and style of font that Emacs uses at
startup (Courier New 10), you could try using `fontset-standard', which
will give you most languages that you have fonts for and Emacs supports.
To use `fontset-standard' for all frames, place the following in your
startup file:

<blockquote><pre>
(setq default-frame-alist
        (append
        '((font . "fontset-startup"))
        default-frame-alist))
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
or, to change for the current frame only:

<blockquote><pre>
(set-frame-font "fontset-startup")
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
To have more control over which fonts are used in a fontset, you need
to specify the fontset manually.

<p>
If only one character set is needed, the easiest way to do this is to
use `create-fontset-from-ascii-font' whereever you define a font.

<blockquote><pre>
(setq default-frame-alist
      (append
       '((font . (create-fontset-from-ascii-font
                  "-*-Andale Mono-normal-r-*-*-13-*-*-*-c-*-iso8859-2")))
       default-frame-alist))
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you require support for a number of languages, you should use
`create-fontset-from-fontset-spec'. Note that installing more than one of
the East Asian language packs is not supported by Microsoft, and does not
work on Windows 95 at least. It is very difficult to get your system stable
again after trying, so it is recommended that you only install the one that
you will use the most, and  <A HREF="#bdf-fonts"> use BDF fonts</A>  for the
other languages:

<blockquote><pre>

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you leave character sets out of the fontset-spec above, a font will
be chosen at random (not necessarily matching any of the other fonts in the
fontset). The fontset name is used to generate the "default" font, which
covers ASCII and iso8859-1.

<p>
To get a full list of character-sets use "M-x describe-fontset" to
describe `fontset-standard'.

You need to use the function `set-w32-system-coding-system' before the

international fonts from <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/intlfonts">ftp.gnu.org/intlfonts</a> as an
example put together by
Jason Rumney &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jasonr@gnu.org">jasonr@gnu.org</A>&gt;

<p>
Download the <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/intlfonts/intlfonts-1.1-split/16dots.tar.gz">16dots.tar.gz</a>
file and unpack it; I'll assume that they are in "c:\intlfonts".  Then set
w32-bdf-filename-alist to the list of fonts returned by using
w32-find-bdf-fonts to enumerate all of the font files. It is a good idea to
set the variable bdf-directory-list at the same time so ps-print knows
where to find the fonts:

<blockquote><pre>
(setq bdf-directory-list
      '("c:/intlfonts/Asian" "c:/intlfonts/Chinese" "c:/intlfonts/Chinese-X"
        "c:/intlfonts/Ethiopic" "c:/intlfonts/European" "c:/intlfonts/Japanese"
        "c:/intlfonts/Japanese-X" "c:/intlfonts/Korean-X" "c:/intlfonts/Misc/"))
(setq w32-bdf-filename-alist
      (w32-find-bdf-fonts bdf-directory-list))

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Then create fontsets for the BDF fonts:

<blockquote><pre>
(create-fontset-from-fontset-spec
 "-*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-16-*-*-*-c-*-fontset-bdf,
 japanese-jisx0208:-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-16-*-*-*-c-*-jisx0208.1983-*,

 tibetan:-TibMdXA-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-m-160-MuleTibetan-0")
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Many of the international bdf fonts from gnu.org are type 0, and
therefore need to be added to font-encoding-alist:

<blockquote><pre>
;; Need to add some fonts to font-encoding-alist since the bdf fonts
;; are type 0 not the default type 1.
(setq font-encoding-alist
      (append '(("MuleTibetan-0" (tibetan . 0))
                ("GB2312"        (chinese-gb2312 . 0))
                ("JISX0208"      (japanese-jisx0208 . 0))
                ("JISX0212"      (japanese-jisx0212 . 0))
                ("VISCII"        (vietnamese-viscii-lower . 0))
                ("KSC5601"       (korean-ksc5601 . 0))
                ("MuleArabic-0"  (arabic-digit . 0))
                ("MuleArabic-1"  (arabic-1-column . 0))
                ("MuleArabic-2"  (arabic-2-column . 0))) font-encoding-alist))
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
You can now use the Emacs font menu (not the popup dialog; see  <A HREF="#font-menu">below</A> ) to select the "bdf: 16-dot medium" fontset, or
you can select it by setting the default font:

<blockquote><pre>
(set-default-font "fontset-bdf")
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Try loading the file etc/HELLO, and you should be able to see the
various international fonts displayed (except for Hindi, which is not
included in the 16-dot font distribution).

<A NAME="translation" title="translation"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC86">How can I control CR/LF translation (e.g., to access UNIX files via NFS)?</a></h3>

<p>
There are a number of methods by which you can control automatic CR/LF
translation in Emacs, a situation that reflects the fact that the default
support isn't very robust.  For a discussion of this issue, take a look at
<a href="ntemacs/todo/translate">this collection of email messages</a> on
the topic.


<A NAME="translation-extension" title="translation-extension"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC87">By file extension</a></h3>

<p>
The first method is by file extension using the alist
<tt>file-name-buffer-file-type-alist</tt>.  This alist contains pairs of
regular expressions and booleans that determine whether a file is opened in
binary (untranslated) or text (translated) mode.  The alist already
contains a number of pairs that you can use as examples for creating your
own; do a "C-h v" on the variable name to see the help text and the default
pairs.

<p>
You could add your own pairs to the alist, or change the alist
entirely.  For example, if you wanted to open every file in binary mode
except for batch files, you could add the following to your startup file:

<blockquote><pre>
(setq file-name-buffer-file-type-alist '(("\.bat$" . nil) (".*" . t)))
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The first pair says anything ending with the <tt>.bat</tt> extension
should be opened in text mode, and the second pair opens everything else
that doesn't match the first pair in binary mode.



<A NAME="translation-file-system" title="translation-file-system"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC88">By file system</a></h3>

<p>
A second method for controlling translation is with the functions at
the end of <a href="ntemacs/contrib/untranslate.el">untranslate.el</a>.
These functions enable you to turn on and off translation on a filesystem
basis (e.g., open anything on <tt>C:</tt> in translated mode, and anything
on <tt>U:</tt> in untranslated mode).  If you want to use these functions,
download and place untranslate.el in your load-path and have it loaded from
your startup file.  Then you can place calls to
<tt>add-untranslated-filesystem</tt> to selectively access filesystems in
binary mode.


<A NAME="translation-automatic" title="translation-automatic"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC89">Automatic</a></h3>

<p>
A third method for controlling translation is to have Emacs scan files
and automatically determine whether they are binary or text by looking at
the line breaks in the file (i.e., no line breaks or just linefeeds imply
binary, carriage return/linefeed pairs imply text).
Chris Weikart &lt;<A HREF="mailto:chris@weikart.com">chris@weikart.com</A>&gt;

<PRE>

<A NAME="multibyte-printing" title="multibyte-printing"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC93">How do I print all these languages that Emacs is now displaying?</a></h3>

<p>
&nbsp;Emacs 20.4 has the ability to print non Western languages in two
ways. Both use the "Postscript Print" functions, so if you do not have a
Postscript printer, you will need to configure Emacs to print through
Ghostscript.
<ol>
<li>Using built-in support in the printer (or in Ghostscript).
<li>Using BDF fonts.
</ol>

<p>
The variable `ps-multibyte-buffer' controls how non-latin characters
are printed. If you are using built in support in the printer or
Ghostscript, then setting this variable appropriately is all that
needs to be done. To use BDF fonts, you will need to tell ps-print
where to find them. This is done by setting `bdf-directory-list'.
For example:

<blockquote><pre>
(setq ps-multibyte-buffer 'bdf-font
      ps-mule-font-info-database ps-mule-font-info-database-bdf
      bdf-directory-list '("c:/intlfonts/European" "c:/intlfonts/Chinese"
                           "c:/intlfonts/Japanese" "c:/intlfonts/Korean-X"))
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
By default, Emacs uses 24 dot BDF fonts for normal text, 16 dot for
bold and italic and 40 dot for some (uncommon) Chinese and Japanese
character sets.

<p>&nbsp;You may need more slashes or the opposite type of slash depending on which
Emacs printing subsystem (i.e. lpr, ps-print, print-nt, w32-print, etc.) you
are using.  Just look at the subsystem's example for a networked printer,
and substitute your machine name as the server and your share name as the

<A NAME="subproc-quoting" title="subproc-quoting"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC95">Quoting issues</a></h3>


<p>
The quoting rules for Windows shells and Cygnus shells have some subtle
differences.  When Emacs spawns subprocesses, it tries to determine whether
the process is a Cygnus program and changes its quoting mechanism
appropriately.  <a href="ntemacs/discuss/shell-quoting">[Discussion]</a>


<A NAME="subproc-console" title="subproc-console"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC96">Programs reading input hang</a></h3>

<p>
Programs that explicitly use a handle to the console ("CON" or "CON:")
instead of stdin and stdout cannot be used as subprocesses to Emacs,
and they will also not work in shell-mode (the default ftp clients on
Windows 95 and NT are examples of such programs - this ftp program is fine for use with <A HREF="#ange-ftp">ange-ftp</A>, but not for M-x ftp).  There is no convenient
way for either Emacs or any shell used in shell-mode to redirect the
input and output of such processes from the console to input and
output pipes.  The only workaround is to use a different
implementation of the program that does not use the console directly
(see the discussion on  <A HREF="#ange-ftp">ange-ftp</A>  for a
replacement for the default ftp clients).



<A NAME="subproc-buffer" title="subproc-buffer"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC97">Buffering in shells</a></h3>

<p>
You may notice that some programs, when run in a shell in shell-mode,
have their output buffered (e.g., people have found this happening to
them with sql-mode).  When the program has a lot of output, it
overflows the buffering and gets printed to the shell buffer; however,
if the program only outputs a small amount of text, it will remain
buffered and won't appear in the shell buffer.

<p>
Although it may at first seem like the shell is buffering the output
from the program, it is actually the program that is buffering output.  The
C runtime typically decides how to buffer output based upon whether stdout
is bound to a handle to a console window or not.  If bound to a console
window, output is buffered line by line; if bound to a block device, such
as a file, output is buffered block by block.

<p>
In a shell buffer, stdout is a pipe handle and so is buffered in
blocks.  If you would like the buffering behavior of your program to behave
differently, the program itself is going to have to be changed; you can use
setbuf and setvbuf to manipulate the buffering semantics.
<p>
  Some programs handle this by having an explicit flag to control their
buffering behaviour, typically "-i".  Other programs manage to detect that
they are running under Emacs, by using getenve("emacs") internally.

<h3><a name="TOC101">Killing subprocesses on Windows 95/98</a></h3>

<p>
Emacs cannot guarantee that a subprocess gets killed on Windows 95/98, and
is a difficult limitation to work around.  For the forseeable future,
you should always let subprocesses run to completion, including
explicitly exiting interactive shells.

<p>
If you find that shutting down Windows 95/98 complains that there is a
running cmdproxy even though you've exited all programs and it doesn't
show up in the Task Manager until you shutdown, this could be a bad
interaction with Norton VirusChecker.

  Francis Wright has written a nice little package which tries to automatically
 tell shell buffer(s) to "exit" if you try to kill them, it is called
 msdos-shell-fix.el, and can be found at :

<p>
When an eof is sent to a subprocess running in an interactive shell
via process-send-eof, the shell terminates unexpectedly as if its
input were closed.  See <a href="ntemacs/todo/shell-ctrl-d">this
description</a> for more info and an example.



<A NAME="shell" title="shell"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC103">How do I use a shell in Emacs?</a></h3>

<p>
You can use an interactive subshell in Emacs by typing "M-x shell".
Emacs uses the SHELL configuration variable to determine which program
to use as the shell.  If you installed Emacs using the addpm.exe
program, then addpm.exe will associate the value %COMSPEC% with SHELL
in the registry.  Emacs will then use the value of the COMSPEC
environment variable when it starts up, <i>unless</i> the SHELL
environment variable is explicitly defined (as when using the
emacs.bat batch file).

<p>
If you would like to specify a different shell for Emacs to use, then
you should do one of two things.  You should either explicitly set the
environment variable SHELL to be the shell you want to use, or, if you want
to have the COMSPEC environment variable determine the shell, then you need
to install Emacs using the addpm.exe program and ensure that the SHELL
environment variable is <i>not</i> defined when you start up Emacs.

<p>
  Any replacement shell should follow Unix convention
 for the -c option, or else be invoked via cmdproxy.exe if it follows
 the DOS convention.

<p>
Note that sh-script.el does not recognize shell names when they have the
'.exe' extension on them.  If you use sh-script, you should omit the '.exe'
extension when specifying the SHELL variable.

<p>
Alternatively, if you do not want to mess with the SHELL or COMSPEC
variables, you can explicitly place the following in your startup file:

<blockquote><pre>
;; For the interactive shell
(setq explicit-shell-file-name "c:/bin/tcsh.exe")

;; For subprocesses invoked via the shell (e.g., "shell -c command")
(setq shell-file-name "c:/bin/tcsh.exe")

<h3><a name="TOC104">bash</a></h3>

<p>
You can get a version of bash with the Cygnus tools at <a href="http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32" >http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32</a>. To
use bash with Emacs, place the following in your startup file:

<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>The latest version of bash sets and uses the environment
variable PID.  For some as yet unknown reason, if PID is set and Emacs
passes it on to bash subshells, bash croaks (Emacs can inherit the PID
variable if it's started from a bash shell).  If you clear the PID variable
in your startup file, you should be able to continue to use bash as your
subshell:

<A NAME="shell-echo" title="shell-echo"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC110">How do I prevent shell commands from being echoed?</a></h3>

<p>
Some shells echo the commands that you send to them, and the echoed
commands appear in the output buffer.  In particular, the default
shells, command.com on Windows 95 and cmd.exe on NT, have this
behavior.

<p>
To prevent echoed commands from being printed, you can place the
following in your startup file:

<blockquote><pre>
(defun my-comint-init ()
  (setq comint-process-echoes t))
(add-hook 'comint-mode-hook 'my-comint-init)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If shell-mode still is not stripping echoed commands, then you'll have
to explicitly tell the shell to not echo commands.  You can do this by
setting the <tt>explicit-<i>SHELL</i>-args</tt> variable
appropriately, where <tt><i>SHELL</i></tt> is the value of your shell
environment variable (do a "M-: (getenv "SHELL")" to see what it is
currently set to).  Assuming that you are on NT and that your SHELL
environment variable is set to cmd.exe, then placing the following in
your startup file will tell cmd.exe to not echo commands:

<blockquote><pre>
(setq explicit-cmd.exe-args '("/q"))
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The comint package will use the value of this variable as an argument
to cmd.exe every time it starts up a new shell (as in shell-mode); the
<tt>/q</tt> is the argument to cmd.exe that stops the echoing (in a
shell, invoking "cmd /?" will show you all of the command line
arguments to cmd.exe).

<p>
Note that this variable is case sensitive; if the value of your SHELL
environment variable is CMD.EXE instead, then this variable needs to be
named <tt>explicit-CMD.EXE-args</tt> instead.


<A NAME="shell-dirsep" title="shell-dirsep"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC111">How do I have Emacs complete directories with / instead of "?</a></h3>

<p>
The character appended to directory names when completing in shell-mode
is determined by the value of the variable
<tt>comint-completion-addsuffix</tt>.  If the value of this variable it
<tt>t</tt>, then a '/' is appended to directory names.  If the value of
this variable is a cons pair, then the first value of the pair is appended.

<p>

<A NAME="shell-invalid" title="shell-invalid"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC112">When I run programs within a shell I get Incorrect DOS version messages. Why?</a></h3>

<p>
This might happen if, for example, you invoke nmake in a shell and it
tries to create subshells.  The problem is related to the one above
where, again, when the shell is initially created, the first argument
to the shell is not the directory in which the shell program resides.
When this happens, command.com fabricates a value for its COMSPEC
environment variable that is incorrect.  Then, when other programs go
to use COMSPEC to find the shell, they are given the wrong value.

<p>
The fix for this is to either prevent any arguments from being sent to
the shell when it starts up (in which case command.com will use a default,
and correct, value for COMSPEC), or to have the first argument be the
directory in which the shell executable resides.

<A NAME="mail" title="mail"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC114">How do I use mail with Emacs?</a></h3>


<p>
You do not need to do much to use mail with Emacs under Windows, but you
do need to be able to communicate with local mail daemons and mail
servers (they do most of the work) to both receive and send mail from
your system.  These daemons and servers are typically running on the
machines in your local network that are already handling mail for you
and/or other users on other systems.

<A NAME="mail-outgoing" title="mail-outgoing"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC115">Outgoing</a></h3>

<p>
For outgoing mail, you need to use smtpmail.el, which enables Emacs to
talk SMTP with mail daemons (smtpmail.el was originally written by
Tomoji Kagatani &lt;kagatani@rbc.ncl.omron.co.jp&gt; and is now included
in the Emacs distribution).  You also need to add the following to
your startup file (be sure to customize for you and your system):

<blockquote><pre>
(setq user-full-name <i>"Your full name"</i>)
(setq user-mail-address <i>"Your email address"</i>)

(setq smtpmail-default-smtp-server <i>"Domain name of machine with SMTP server"</i>)
(setq smtpmail-local-domain nil)
(setq send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)

(load-library "smtpmail")
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Note that if you want to change the name of the smtp server after
you've loaded smtpmail.el, you'll want to change the variable
<tt>smtpmail-smtp-server</tt>.

<p>
If you are using GNUS to send mail, then you will also need:

<blockquote><pre>
(load-library "message")
(setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you are experiencing problems with sending large messages, check
the value of the variable <tt>smtpmail-debug-info</tt>.  If it is
non-nil, you should set it to nil:

<blockquote><pre>
(setq smtpmail-debug-info nil)
</pre></blockquote>


<A NAME="mail-queued-outgoing" title="mail-queued-outgoing"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC116">Outgoing: Queued</a></h3>

<p>
If you would like to queue your outgoing mail so that you can then
later send it all as a batch (e.g., when you are working disconnected on a
laptop), you can use the feedmail package written by Bill Carpenter
&lt;bill@bubblegum.net&gt;.

<p>
Feedmail comes with Emacs 20.

<p>
Fabio Somenzi &lt;Fabio@Colorado.EDU&gt; also sent the following as an
example of setting up Feemail:

<blockquote><pre>
(setq send-mail-function 'feedmail-send-it)
(autoload 'feedmail-send-it "feedmail")
(autoload 'feedmail-run-the-queue "feedmail")
(setq feedmail-buffer-eating-function 'feedmail-buffer-to-smtpmail)
(setq feedmail-enable-queue t) ; optional
(setq feedmail-queue-chatty nil) ; optional
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Fabio also redefined the function <tt>make-auto-save-file-name</tt> to
auto-save files in one local directory ($HOME/.save) and to strip out
invalid characters in file names .  Note
that all files will auto-save to this directory; this allows Emacs to
auto-save even when the folder files are on an inaccessible remote machine.
Place the following definition of <a href="ntemacs/contrib/masfn.el"><tt>make-auto-save-file-name</tt></a> in
your startup file to override the definition in winnt.el.

<p>
Lastly, if you would like to protect the primary folder from crashes
while it is being written back to disk, then also place the following in
your startup file (assuming you use VM):

<blockquote><pre>
(add-hook 'vm-mode-hook
          '(lambda ()
             (make-local-variable 'file-precious-flag)
             (setq file-precious-flag t)))
</pre></blockquote>


<A NAME="mail-rmail" title="mail-rmail"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC117">Incoming: RMAIL and POP3</a></h3>

<p>
For incoming mail using the RMAIL package and a POP3 mail server, you
need only place the following in your startup file (again, be sure to
customize):

<blockquote><pre>
(setenv "MAILHOST" <i>"Domain name of machine with POP3 server"</i>)
(setq rmail-primary-inbox-list
    '("po:<i>Your login</i>") rmail-pop-password-required t)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Note that you will need to customize the <i>Domain name of machine
with POP3 server</i> and <i>Your login</i> fields to be the name of
your POP server and your login name.


<A NAME="mail-vm-pop3" title="mail-vm-pop3"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC118">Incoming: VM and POP3</a></h3>

<p>
For incoming mail using the VM package and a POP3 mail server, you
first need the vm package (check any elisp archive) and then you need
to place the following in your .vm configuration file:

<blockquote><pre>
(setq vm-spool-files
      (list
       (list "~/INBOX"
             "<i>POP3 server</i>:110:pass:<i>POP user name</i>:<i>*</i>"
             "~/INBOX.CRASH")))
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Note that you will need to customize the <i>POP3 server</i> and <i>POP
user name</i> fields to be your login name and the name of your POP
server.  You will also probably want to customize the name of your
inbox and crash files (<tt>~/INBOX</tt> and <tt>~/INBOX.CRASH</tt> in
the example above.)


<A NAME="mail-gnus" title="mail-gnus"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC119">Incoming: GNUS</a></h3>

If you want to share your rmail folders between Unix and Windows NT/95, you'll

want to treat the directory in which you store your mail as an untranslated
file system; see <a href="#translation">the section on translation below on

Mail packages often provide some way to notify you when email has

<h3><a name="TOC123">Leaving on server: RMAIL</a></h3>

<p>
Franklin Lee &lt;lee.franklin@worldnet.att.net&gt; has extended the
pop3 package so that you can have your mail left on the server instead
of always being downloaded (it also has a biff-mode with international
"barks", which can be used whether or not you download or leave your
mail on the server).  You'll need to download a zip archive containing
a patched pop3.el and some additional elisp files:

<ul>
<li><a href="ntemacs/contrib/ep3m-098.zip">ep3m-098.zip</a> (8/13/99)
<li><a href="ntemacs/contrib/ep3m-098/README.TXT">README.TXT</a> (8/13/99)
</ul>

<p>
If you unpack on Unix, be sure to use "unzip -a" to strip any carriage
returns.

<p>
For instructions on how to install and configure this package so that
you can leave your mail on your pop3 servers, see the instructions at the
top of the <a href="ntemacs/contrib/ep3m-097/epop3mail.el">epop3mail.el

This should potentially work with other mail packages that rely upon

<h3><a name="TOC138">How do I use FTP, (ange-ftp), within Emacs?</a></h3>
<b>20.3</b><br>

<p>
Emacs 20.3 comes with an ange-ftp.el that can use the standard Windows
ftp.exe, so you should not need to download anything to use ange-ftp.
<p>
If you are behind a firewall you may have problems, because the native
FTP client doesn't support passive mode, if this is the case then you'll
need to download <a href="ntemacs/contrib/ftp.exe">ftp.exe</a>, and follow the instructions below.

<p>
Place the ftp.exe executable in a directory where you keep your local
executables.  Then be sure that the exec-path variable is set so that, when
Emacs runs the ftp.exe program, it runs the one you downloaded (and not the
default one).  As an example, assuming that you placed ftp.exe in, say,
%HOME%\bin, you could set exec-path as follows in your startup file:

<blockquote><pre>
(setq exec-path (cons (expand-file-name "~/bin") exec-path))
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
As another alternative, you can tell ange-ftp exactly which ftp program
to use by customizing ange-ftp-ftp-program-name, e.g.:

<blockquote><pre>
(setq ange-ftp-ftp-program-name "c:/bin/ftp.exe")
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
With this method you don't have to worry about the wrong ftp program
being picked up through exec-path.

<p>
You will also want to customize the temporary directory that ange-ftp
uses to cache files:

<blockquote><pre>
(setq ange-ftp-tmp-name-template
      (concat (expand-file-name (getenv "TEMP")) "/ange-ftp"))
(setq ange-ftp-gateway-tmp-name-template
      (concat (expand-file-name (getenv "TEMP")) "/ange-ftp"))
</pre></blockquote>


<A NAME="telnet" title="telnet"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC139">How do I use telnet with Emacs?</a></h3>

<p>
Before you can use telnet-mode from within Emacs, you need a telnet
client other than the one found on the system; the system telnet is a
windows app, and cannot be used as a subprocess since it does not use stdio
for input and output.

<p>
Two possible telnet clients that you can use are:

<ul>

<li><a href="ntemacs/contrib/telnet.zip">telnet</a>, a Windows version
of telnet by Igor Milavec modified to use stdio by Naftali Ramati
&lt;naftali@harmonic.co.il&gt; (includes source).

<p>
Unfortunately, this telnet program requires that the host be specified on
the command line, but telnet-mode wants to specify the host using the
"open" command once telnet has started.  Zoltan Kemenczy
&lt;zoltan@nabu.isg.mot.com&gt; has <a href="ntemacs/contrib/telnet-mode.el">written a version of the telnet-mode
function</a> that does this.  To use it, place "(require 'telnet)" in your
startup file, followed by Zoltan's new telnet-mode code.

<p>
If the new telnet-mode still does not work for you, then you will
probably find it easiest to run telnet inside of a shell buffer (instead of
using telnet-mode).  If you use the Borland C compiler and want to do a
little hacking, it would be great if you could change this telnet to be
able to start up without requiring a host on the command line.  The source
is included in the above zip file, and Naftali has <a href="ntemacs/discuss/telnet">some tips</a> for making this change.

<p>
<li><a href="ntemacs/contrib/jtelnet-1.0.tar.gz">jtelnet</a>,
a Java telnet application by Ivan Ganza &lt;iganza@watchit.com&gt;
(8/6/97).

<p>
The jtelnet page describes how to set it up for use with Emacs.  For the
other telnet client, you can either place the telnet.exe program in your
exec-path (e.g., anywhere in your PATH, or in the Emacs bin directory) or
set the <tt>telnet-program</tt> variable in your startup file to point to
the executable.

The Emacs 20.3 pretests and above support the Intellimouse on both NT

<p>
Clicking the mouse wheel is interpreted as a mouse-2 event, which is
normally bound to mouse-yank-at-click (i.e., paste).  Since it is easy to
accidentally click the mouse wheel, you might find that you inadvertantly
paste text as you scroll the wheel.  To prevent this from happening, you
can disable the mouse-2 binding in your startup file:

<blockquote><pre>
(global-unset-key [mouse-2])

<h3><a name="TOC152">How do I use the perl debugger with Emacs?</a></h3>

<p>
From Jay Rogers &lt;jay@rgrs.com&gt;:

<blockquote>
There are potentially two problems that cause the perl debugger to hang
when started in emacs.  One's an emacs problem while the other's a perl
problem.

<p>
First, get Emacs 19.34.4 or later for Windows 95/NT.  It contains a fix that
allows emacs to read all ASCII characters from the perl debugger, including
the dreaded ^Z (aka EOF in DOS).  It also groks the "drive:path" filename
notation.

<p>
Second, some versions of the perl debugger itself need to be patched to
work with emacs.  They are perl versions 5.001 and less, and version
5.004_01.  To fix, locate and change the code similar to the following code
in lib/perl5db.pl

<pre>
    if (-e "/dev/tty") {
        $console = "/dev/tty";
        $rcfile=".perldb";
    }
    elsif (-e "con") {
        $console = "";                 <---- change "con" to ""
        $rcfile="perldb.ini";
    }
    else {
        $console = "sys\$command";
        $rcfile="perldb.ini";
    }

it can be used with Emacs 19.34.  For more information, see the description
of python-mode at <a href="http://www.python.org/emacs/python-mode/" >http://www.python.org/emacs/python-mode/</a>.



<A NAME="grep" title="grep"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC154">How do I use grep with Emacs?</a></h3>

<p>
To use grep with Emacs, you first need to obtain a version of grep.
Many of the packages listed in the section below on  <A HREF="#other-tools">Unix Tools</A>  come with a version of grep (and cousins
egrep and fgrep).  Once you have grep, be sure that it is in your system
path or in Emacs' exec-path.  Then you should be able grep from within
Emacs using "M-x grep".

<p>
If you can't get access to grep, then you can use the findstr program
that comes with Windows NT and Windows 95 instead.  It is much more limited in its
searching ability, but if you have simple needs it may be adequate.  Peter
Breton &lt;pbreton@i-kinetics.com&gt; <a href="ntemacs/discuss/findstr">shows you how to do this</a>.

<p>
Some users find the igrep package to be a more useful package for using
grep (for example, it supports <A HREF="($grep-recursive)">recursive greps</A> directly).  Here are some <a href="ntemacs/discuss/igrep">pointers</a> from other users on what you need
to do to get igrep working on your system.  You can download igrep from the
elisp archive at <a href="ftp://ftp.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/emacs-lisp/misc/igrep.el.gz">ftp://ftp.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/emacs/emacs-lisp/misc/igrep.el.gz</a>.


<A NAME="grep-recursive" title="grep-recursive"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC155">How do I do a recursive grep?</a></h3>

<p>
To do a recursive grep, you need the help of some other utilities.
Probably included in the same package that has grep will be find, a program
that can recursively traverse directories and invoke programs on the files
it finds.  To do a recursive grep with find, invoke "M-x grep" and run the
following command:

<blockquote><pre>
find . -name <i>pattern</i> -exec grep -n <i>string</i> NUL {} ;
</pre></blockquote>

(Note that find is not the same program as the find that comes with
Windows, rather a port of the GNU Findutils component).

<p>
The <i>pattern</i> argument determines which files are matched (e.g.,
"*.c" for all .c files).  The <i>string</i> argument specifies the string
that you are searching for.  And the <tt>NUL</tt> argument is a standard
way to ensure that grep reports filenames in the matches (grep reports
filenames when it is invoked on more than one file, and the NUL device is
simply another file that will never contain matches; on Unix, you would use
/dev/null).

<p>
If you also have the xargs program, than you can make the recursive
grep more efficient.  Instead of the above command, use:

<blockquote><pre>
find . -name <i>pattern</i> -print | xargs grep -n <i>string</i> NUL
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The xargs command collects lines from its input and concentates them
together as one list of arguments, and invokes the specified program with
the argument list (breaking the arguments up into multiple lists and
invocations if necessary).  The above command first uses find to print out
the set of filenames that match <i>pattern</i>, which then gets passed to
xargs.  xargs concatenates the lines of filenames into lists of arguments
and invokes grep on them.

<p>
This is an app note on how to use Microsoft Visual C++ with Emacs. The
experiments done below were done with Emacs 19.34.1 on Windows 95, using
Visual C++ 4.0 Standard Edition. Your mileage may vary.

<p>
This writeup assumes minimal knowledge of Emacs hacking on the part of
the reader.


<A NAME="vcppEnvironment" title="vcppEnvironment"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC161">VC++ Environmental Variables</a></h3>

<p>
First, Emacs requires any environmental variables to be set at boot time, in autoexec.bat (for Windows 95). This includes variables such as HOME. So if you haven't already done so, set the environment up so that Emacs' compile mode will correctly run VC++. There is a batch file in your VC++ installation's bin directory called "vcvars32.bat". Call it from your autoexec.bat file. Make sure you use the "call" keyword, or execution never returns from the called batch file. Here is what the relevant portion of my autoexec.bat looks like:

<pre>
rem set up for MS C++ 4.0
call d:\msdevstd\bin\vcvars32.bat
</pre>

<p>
Under NT, you can set the HOME and other environment variables in the System applet of the Control Panel.

<p>
<a href="mailto:jgardner@maxserv.com">John Huxoll Gardner</a> writes
that
<pre>
These environment variables can be set through the control panel.

Control Panel->System->Environment tab

set include to d:\msdev\include;d:\msdev\mfc\include (or whatever)
set lib to d:\msdev\lib;d:\msdev\mfc\lib (or whatever)
set MSDevDir to d:\msdev
</pre>

<p>
You should now be able to compile from Emacs. Load a source file from a VC++ project. Type M-X compile. Replace the proposed command line with:

<pre>
nmake -f MyProject.mak
</pre>

<p>
You will find that this defaults to a win 32 debug build. You can change it to a release build with:

<pre>
nmake -f MyProject.mak CFG="MyProject - Win32 Release"
</pre>

<p>
By the way, you can scroll in the M-X command buffer with up and down arrows. You can also scroll in the compile command buffer with the up and down arrows. Both seem to be fully editable as well.

<A NAME="vcppSetting" title="vcppSetting"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC162">Setting the Default Command Line</a></h3>

<p>
Now set up the default value for the compile command line. Add the following to your .Emacs:

<pre>
; Set up for Visual C++ compiling
(setq compile-command '("nmake -f .mak " . 10))
</pre>

<p>
If you work on the same project extensively, toss that in to the default string. You can always override it when you work on another project.

<p>
By the way, many if not all Microsoft command line programs now accept
a dash (-) as a switch specifier as well as a slash (/). This was true as
long ago as Mess-DOS 6.0, I believe. I use it because that eliminates one
area where I have to remember which OS I am using. <tt>:-)</tt>

<p>
<a href="mailto:sasdjb@unx.sas.com">David Biesack</a> suggests that perhaps
it's easy to define Makefile in the project directory which does

<pre>
PROJECT=MyProject
all: debug
debug: FORCE
        nmake /f $(PROJECT).mak CFG="$(PROJECT) - Win32 Debug"
release: FORCE
        nmake /f $(PROJECT).mak CFG="$(PROJECT) - Win32 Release"
FORCE:
</pre>

<p>
and then you can simply change compile-command to "nmake".

<p>
<a href="mailto:deupreec@interagp.com">Caleb T. Deupree</a> reports that on
VC++ 5.0 and up, "You can also set an option on Options/Build to export a
makefile every time the project is saved, which you can then use to compile
with 'nmake -f project.mak'." VC++ 4.0 builds the make file every time, and
there is no option.

<A NAME="vcppHandling" title="vcppHandling"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC163">Handling Compile Time Errors</a></h3>

<p>
Those of you who never get compile time errors can skip this section.

<p>
One of the things that compile.el provides is the ability to scan the
output from a compile session, and move from error message to error
message. This facility depends on a series of regular expressions
("regexes") which are applied to search the compiler output. Normally, you
shouldn't have to do anything. However, if you have problems with this
facility, you can comment out the regexes you don't need and
recompile. Search the file for "compilation-error-regexp-alist" and comment
out as needed.

<p>
To recompile, make the file the active buffer. Emacs will recognize it
as an elisp file, and add a pull-down menu for elisp functions. One is for
compiling, the other will compile and then load.

<p>
By the way, the best (and so far, only :-) book I've seen on regular
expressions is Jeffrey E. F. Friedl, <a href="http://www.ora.com/catalog/regex/" >*Mastering Regular
Expressions*</a>, <a href="http://www.ora.com/" >O'Reilly &amp; Assoc</a>,
Inc, 1997. It covers regex syntax and usage for Emacs, perl and other tools
that regexes.

<A NAME="vcppReverting" title="vcppReverting"><!-- Anchor--></A>
<h3><a name="TOC164">Reverting Buffers</a></h3>

<p>
Then there is the problem that sometimes you modify the source from Microsoft's IDE. Here's some help for that.

<p>
Occasionally, you need to add a new function or variable from the
Visual C++ IDE. This means that the copy of the file in your Emacs buffer
is now obsolete. The simplest thing to is a two part manual effort. First,
before you leave Emacs for VC++, make sure you save all your buffers (C-X
S). When you return, you can revert buffers you know have been changed with
M-X revert-buffer. If you try to modify a file that has been changed from
outside Emacs (say, by VC++), Emacs will warn you and offer you the chance
to revert the buffer, so you can safely try modifying files after making a
change from VC++.

<p>
However, this depends on the user remembering to do something, always a
hazard. The obvious way to handle the problem is to automate it, which <a href="mailto:andersl@csd.uu.se">Anders Lindgren</a> has already done. He
writes:

<pre>
This feature will be present in the next version of Emacs.  There will be
two modes, `global-auto-revert-mode' that applies to all buffers while
`auto-revert-mode' can be activated for individual buffers.

You can get the latest version from:

    <a href="http://www.csd.uu.se/%7Eandersl/emacs.shtml" >http://www.csd.uu.se/~andersl/emacs.shtml</a>

Please note that this feature comes with a prize: Normally Emacs acts like
an extra backup system, keeping a copy of the files you are editing.
Should some external program mess up a file, you can always save the copy
you're editing.  When using Auto-Revert mode Emacs will happily load the

(Now, *that* is an elisp hacker's sig line! <tt>:-)</tt>

<p>
The next version of Emacs to which Anders refers is, I believe, 20. I
don't know when it will be released.

<p>
If you can't wait, you can scarf the source for autorevert.el in from
Anders' web page. However, it is dependent on another Emacs package,
Custom, which is not in the version of Emacs I have (19.34.1). Custom is
available at <a href="http://www.dina.kvl.dk/%7Eabraham/custom/" >http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/custom/</a>. Installing
the Custom package is beyond my meager elisp hacking skills, so you are on
your own there. The next release will also include Custom.

<p>
<a href="mailto:deupreec@interagp.com">Caleb T. Deupree</a> also
writes, "You might also mention a package mode-compile.el, which is a
wrapper around compile mode and is available from the Emacs lisp archive or
from <a href="http://www.cenatls.cena.dgac.fr/%7Eboubaker/Emacs/index.html" >http://www.cenatls.cena.dgac.fr/~boubaker/Emacs/index.html</a>.
It detects makefiles in directories and parses them for valid targets,
performing many of the same tasks which you do in your hooks."

<p>
You can also set up VC++ to import a file into Emacs for you, all
ready for editing. You will need the <a href="#assoc">Gnuclient
package</a>, which is used to associate file extensions with Emacs. In
VC++, go to the Tools pulldown menu, and click on Customize.... In the
Tools tab, click on Add. Use Browse to locate your gnuclientw.exe
file, and select it. For arguments, use +$(CurLine) "$(FilePath)" and
for the directory use the $(WkspDir) (the quotes around FilePath
handle paths with spaces in them). Set the Menu Text to say
"Em&amp;acs". The "+$(CurLine)" will set point in Emacs to the same
line as the cursor position in VC++. The ampersand in the word
"Em&amp;acs" allows you to select emacs from the keyboard. (E is
already used for the OLE control test container.)

<p>
You should now be able to go to any source file in your project. Then,
use the pull-down menu Tools-&gt;Emacs. The active file in your VC++ ide
should now be front and center in Emacs, all ready to edit as you wish. If
you use keystrokes to work the menus, try &lt;alt&gt;T A to move the file
into Emacs. Binding this tool to a keystroke will be left as an exercise
for the student.

<p>
If you have the option of saving files before running tools, make sure
this option is set. (I don't see it on VC++ 4.0.)

<h3><a name="TOC179">How do I use the perl debugger with Emacs?</a></h3>

<p>
From Jay Rogers &lt;jay@rgrs.com&gt;:

<blockquote>
There are potentially two problems that cause the perl debugger to hang
when started in emacs.  One's an emacs problem while the other's a perl
problem.

<p>
First, get Emacs 19.34.4 or later for Windows 95/98/NT.  It contains a fix that
allows emacs to read all ASCII characters from the perl debugger, including
the dreaded ^Z (aka EOF in DOS).  It also groks the "drive:path" filename
notation.

<p>
Second, some versions of the perl debugger itself need to be patched to
work with emacs.  They are perl versions 5.001 and less, and version
5.004_01.  To fix, locate and change the code similar to the following code
in lib/perl5db.pl

<pre>
    if (-e "/dev/tty") {
        $console = "/dev/tty";
        $rcfile=".perldb";
    }
    elsif (-e "con") {
        $console = "";                 <---- change "con" to ""
        $rcfile="perldb.ini";
    }
    else {
        $console = "sys\$command";
        $rcfile="perldb.ini";
    }

Probably the first place you should look for more GNU tools is at
Cygwin toolset.  The toolset is a port of the GNU tools to the Windows
API, as well as a set of libraries that allow Unix programs to compile
to Windows with little or no modification.  The project is at <a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/" >http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/</a>
</p>
<p>
Michael Main &lt;main@cs.colorado.edy&gt; has collected together ports
of various Unix programming environments and languages to Windows for
classes that he teaches.  See <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/%7Emain/plcd.html" >http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/plcd.html</a>
for an overview; e.g., a version of the mingw32 port of Unix tools is at <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/%7Emain/mingw32/" >http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/mingw32/</a>.
</p>
<p>
There is also a directory of GNU software which has been ported to the
Windows platform, which is available at <A HREF="http://www.gnusoftware.com/">http://www.gnusoftware.com/</A>.  This directory also contains several
patches for Emacs running on Windows, to give extra functionality, see
<A HREF="http://www.gnusoftware.com/Emacs/">here</A> for details.
</p>
<p>
The UWIN project at AT&amp;T Research is another project whose goal is to
enable UNIX applications to build and run with little or no modification on
Windows NT/95.  Part of the UWIN project includes a port of ksh done by
David Korn.  For more information, see <a href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin" >http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin</a>.
</p>

<p>
An older set of the GNU tools that I have seen offered on ftp sites for
NT and Windows 95 have been based on the Congruent tools (I have heard mixed
reviews of these ports, so use with your own discretion).  An ftp site that
seems to offer the full set of these tools is <a href="ftp://ftp.cc.utexas.edu/microlib/nt/gnu">ftp.cc.utexas.edu/microlib/nt/gnu</a>.
</p>

<p>
Microsoft also has a collection of tools for use with NT, including
Unix tools such as cron, ps, kill, and nice, as well as a number of NT
specific tools.  A list of these tools is at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/exec/vendors/freeshare/maintnce.asp" >http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/exec/vendors/freeshare/maintnce.asp</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you're a perl user, then you probably want the port of perl to Windows.
You can download a perl distribution from any of the CPAN mirror sites,
such as <a href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/perl/CPAN/ports/win32/Standard/">ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/perl/CPAN/ports/win32/Standard/</a>.
