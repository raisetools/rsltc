This is a new and rather untested installation for MacOS.  It should
work for both PowerPC and Intel machines.  rsltc was compiled to run
on both processors; SML, PVS and SAL seem to be compiled for PowerPCs but
will also run on Intels.

You should already have emacs installed.

You will need root access rights.

1.  Uncompress rsltc.gz and place it on your path (or set exec-path
    accordingly - see below).

2.  Unpack rsl_share.tgz in /usr/share.  This will create a directory
    /usr/share/rsltc, itself containing 4 sub-directories.

3.  Unpack rsl_emacs.tgz in a directory that is on your emacs load-path,
    or, if you prefer, in some other directory <dir>.  In the latter
    case add to your .emacs file

(setq load-path (cons "<dir>" load-path))

4.  Add to your .emacs file 

(require 'rsl-mode)

5.  Install a fairly recent SML from http://www.smlnj.org/.  We have
    tested with 110.59.  Make sure that the binary sml is on your path
    (or set exec-path accordingly - see below).

6.  Install PVS from http://pvs.csl.sri.com/prototypes.shtml.  There
    is a bug in version 3.3 that currently makes it not work with the
    RSL libraries for PVS, but we hope there will be a fix for this
    soon.  (Versions before 3.3 do not have a Mac version available.)
    Make sure pvs is on your path (or set exec-path accordingly - see
    below). 

7.  Install SAL from http://sal.csl.sri.com/sal-2.3-binaries.shtml
    Make sure the sal binaries such as sal-smc are on your path (or
    set exec-path accordingly - see below). 

8.  If you are not starting Emacs from a terminal in X11 but rather
    using a native MacOS X application, make sure that it knows about
    your PATH environment variable. You may have to set the
    'exec-path' variable correspondingly in the .emacs initialization
    file.
