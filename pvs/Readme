This directory contains the RSL library files for use with the PVS
translator.

To install these files, store rsl_prelude.pvs and rsl_prelude.prf in a
directory X, say.

Start pvs in directory X.

Issue the command M-x load-prelude-library, and give Y/lib/finite_sets
at the prompt, where Y is the dirctory where PVS is located.  This
loads the finite sets library.

Open rsl_prelude.pvs, run the type checker on it and exit.

You can now, when running PVS on files translated from RSL files, load
the RSL library by using the command M-x load-prelude-library and
giving X at the prompt (the directory where you stored
rsl_prelude.pvs).  This only needs to be done once in each directory,
as it is recorded in the directory's .pvscontext file.
