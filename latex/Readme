Files needed to support RSL with LaTeX are included here.  See section
14 of the user guide.

boxedminipage.sty is needed by rslenv.sty (but may already be in your
LaTeX distribution).

rslenv.sty (and if necessary boxedminipage.sty) should be placed
somewhere with your other LaTeX style files.  You will need to run
texhash (on Unix systems) or update MiKTeX (on Windows) afterwards.

rslconvert.el and tokenise.el should be placed on your emacs
load-path.

NTTeXing.html is a useful guide to setting up emacs and LaTeX in
Windows.
