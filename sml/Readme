This directory contains a Windows zip file for Standard ML of
New Jersey.  Tar files for building SML for other architectures can be
obtained from http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/.  If you are
using Linux then you should install the package from smlnj.  You will
also need to install a package libsmlnj-smlnj if it exists in your
distribution.


To install sml on Windows:

1.  Make a folder C:\sml
2.  Unpack the zip file there, using subfolders
3.  Add an environment variable SMLNJ_HOME, set to C:\sml
4.  Add C:\sml\bin to your Path environment variable

Also included here are rslml.sml and rslml.cm.  These are used to create
a library for RSL that is used by the SML translator option of rsltc.

To install these you should place them in a folder and then set up
an environment variable RSLML_PATH to point to that folder.  In
Windows you should set up a folder C:\raise\sml containing 
these files and then set the environment variable RSLML_PATH to that folder.

If you use a different folder then both RSLML_PATH and the contents
of rslml.cm shouild be changed accordingly.

The first time you run an SML file generated from rsltc the RSL library
will be compiled.  Thereafter it will just be loaded.

If you are using emacs version 20 in Windows, or version 19 or 20 in
Linux or Unix, then you should move the sml*.el files to your
site-lisp directory.  Then if your .emacs file contains

(load "sml-site")
(load "rsl-mode")
 
then you can run SML from emacs, and the extra item for running it
will appear in the RSL menu when visiting an RSL file.  Otherwise, run
SML separately and use the SML command

use "path/X.sml";

to load the file created by the SML translator from X.rsl, with the
appropriate path.  Don't forget the ; at the end of this command.
